Greetings! ðŸš€

As part of this assessment, I am thrilled to present a Playwright-Cucumber framework developed in TypeScriptâ€”a powerful combination for efficient and maintainable end-to-end testing. This framework reflects my commitment to delivering robust, scalable, and readable automation solutions.

Key Features:

Cross-Browser and Cross-Platform Testing:

Leverages Playwright's extensive browser support (Chrome, Firefox, WebKit) for comprehensive cross-browser testing.
Ensures compatibility across diverse platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

TypeScript for Strong Typing:

Utilizes TypeScript to bring static typing to the framework, enhancing code quality and facilitating early error detection.
Leverages TypeScript features such as interfaces and type checking for robust and maintainable test scripts.

Gherkin Syntax with Cucumber:

Implements BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) using Gherkin syntax with Cucumber.
Enhances collaboration by providing a human-readable format for writing and understanding tests.

CI/CD Integration:

Seamlessly integrates into CI/CD pipelines for continuous testing.
Ensures that every code change undergoes automated testing to maintain high software quality.

Reusable Step Definitions:

Promotes a modular and scalable approach to test automation.
Encourages the creation of reusable step definitions, reducing redundancy and enhancing maintainability.

Getting Started:

* Clone the repository.
* Install dependencies: npm install
* Run tests: npm test
* Explore the framework's codebase to gain insights into the structure, organization, and implementation of Playwright-Cucumber in TypeScript.

Thank you for considering my work. I look forward to discussing the framework in more detail and showcasing its capabilities.
